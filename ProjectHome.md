This program enables tethering (via **USB**) for "rooted" handsets running android (such as the Android DevPhone 1). A client (your laptop for example) can connect via usb and get access to the internet using the 3G, 2G mobile connection or the wifi connection which is established by the handset.

This program has been tested with Linux and Microsoft Windows clients. The client needs to support [RNDIS](http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/network/ndis/rmndis.mspx).

A kernel with the enabled RNDIS features needs to be applied on your mobile. Please consult the [FAQ](http://code.google.com/p/android-wired-tether/wiki/FAQ) for details.

**Special thanks** to **Zinx Verituse** who has ported the essential parts from the hero-kernel!
